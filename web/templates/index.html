<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    Autodeb is a service that provides a way to test Debian source packages.
    It empowers Debian Developers by giving them easy access to more rigorous
    testing before they upload a package to the archive. It runs tests that
    Debian Developers donâ€™t necessarily run because of lack of time and
    resources.
</p>

<p>
    In the future, Autodeb will also  attempt to automatically update Debian
    packages to newer upstream versions or to backport them. Resulting
    packages will be distributed in apt repositories.
</p>

<h2>Getting started with the service</h2>
<hr>

<p>
   <strong>1. Associating a PGP key to your account</strong>
</p>

<p>
    To get started with using Autodeb, the first thing that you need to do is
    log into the service and associate a PGP key with your account. This is
    done from the <a href="/profile">profile page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>2. Adding autodeb to your dput configuration</strong>
</p>

<p>
    This server has a REST API that can be very useful if you want to build
    automated tools to interact with it. However, it also accepts uploads via
    dput. You can add autodeb to your configured dput hosts by adding the
    following lines to <span class="font-italic">~/.dput.cf</span>:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
[autodeb]
fqdn = {{ .Data.ServerURL }}
incoming = /upload
method = http
allowed_distributions = .
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>3. Uploading a package</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Before you upload a package, you should know that autodeb only accepts
    signed source uploads. Anything other than that will be rejected with an
    error message.
</p>

<p>
    You may upload a package to autodeb with the following command:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>$ dput autodeb &ltpackage.changes&gt</code>
</pre>


</p>
    Note that neither dput nor dput-ng display http error messages, they only
    display the error code. Autodeb always tries to return a 4XX error code
    when there is something wrong with the upload. If your uploads yields a 5XX
    code, it might be a good idea to get in touch with us so that we can fix
    the bug.
</p>

<p>
    If your upload was rejected, you can obtain the error message by
    re-uploading the failed file with curl:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>$ FILE=&ltfilename&gt ; curl -w "\n" -X PUT -T $FILE {{ .Data.ServerURL }}/upload/$FILE</code>
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>4. Obtaining logs</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Now that you have completed an upload, your it will be visible in the
    <a href="/uploads">uploads page</a> with a dget-compatible
    <span class="font-italic">.dsc</span> link. A build job will also be
    created and it will be visible in the <a href="/jobs">jobs page</a>. As
    soon as the job is completed by one of the autodeb workers, the logs will
    be available for download.
</p>

<h2>What's next</h2>

<p>
    In the future, Autodeb will:

    <ul>
        <li>generate autopkgtests jobs for both the uploaded package</li>
        <li>generate autopkgtests jobs for the package's dependencies</li>
        <li>host the resulting <span class="font-italic">.debs</span></li>
        <li>provide a range of controls for the build environment</li>
        <li>automatically backport and/or update packages from the Debian archive to new upstream versions</li>
    </ul>
</p>
