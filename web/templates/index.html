<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    Autodeb is a work-in-progress service developed in the context of a Google
    Summer of Code project. The main goals of the service are to automate
    building, testing and distributing Debian packages.
</p>

</p>
    The service focuses on two main use cases:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        1. Generate and distribute backports and packages for new upstream
        versions automatically
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Autodeb will periodically attempt to update all packages in the Debian
    archive to new upstream versions when they are available. It will also try
    to backport all packages in the archive to previous Debian versions.
    Resulting packages will be distributed and the build logs will be made
    available. We hope that the resulting information will be useful to package
    maintainers. The resulting builds could also be used by Debian users so
    that they are left with a deb-based alternative when there are no packages
    for their needs in Debian itself.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        2. Enable Debian package maintainers to test their packages (and their
        reverse dependencies) before each upload
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Autodeb will empower Debian package maintainers by giving them easy access
    to thorough testing before every upload. It will run tests that are not
    often run due to lack of time or resources. Autodeb will provide a
    dput-compatible API. Instead of uploading your packages directly to the
    ftp-master upload queue, you may upload your source packages to Autodeb
    where they will be built on all release architectures. Autopkgtests will
    also be ran on all resulting deb packages and their reverse dependencies.
    Optionally, the upload will be forwarded to the ftp-master queue if all
    tests succeed.
</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started with the service</h2>
<hr>

<p>
   <strong>1. Associating a PGP key to your account</strong>
</p>

<p>
    To get started with using Autodeb, the first thing that you need to do is
    log into the service and associate a PGP key with your account. This is
    done from the <a href="/profile/pgp-keys">pgp-keys page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>2. Adding autodeb to your dput configuration</strong>
</p>

<p>
    This server has a REST API that can be very useful if you want to build
    automated tools to interact with it. However, it also accepts uploads via
    dput. You can add autodeb to your configured dput hosts by adding the
    following lines to <span class="font-italic">~/.dput.cf</span>:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
[autodeb]
fqdn = {{ .Data.ServerHostnamePort }}
incoming = /upload
method = {{ .Data.ServerScheme }}
allowed_distributions = .
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>3. Uploading a package</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Before you upload a package, you should know that autodeb only accepts
    signed source uploads. Anything other than that will be rejected with an
    error message.
</p>

<p>
    You may upload a package to autodeb with the following command:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>$ dput autodeb &ltpackage.changes&gt</code>
</pre>


</p>
    Note that neither dput nor dput-ng display http error messages, they only
    display the error code. Autodeb always tries to return a 4XX error code
    when there is something wrong with the upload. If your uploads yields a 5XX
    code, it might be a good idea to get in touch with us so that we can fix
    the bug.
</p>

<p>
    If your upload was rejected, you can obtain the error message by
    re-uploading the failed file with curl:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>$ FILE=&ltfilename&gt ; curl -w "\n" -X PUT -T $FILE {{ .Data.ServerURL }}/upload/$FILE</code>
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>4. Obtaining logs</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Now that you have completed an upload, it will be visible in the
    <a href="/uploads">uploads page</a> with a dget-compatible
    <span class="font-italic">.changes</span> link. A build job will also be
    created and it will be visible in the <a href="/jobs">jobs page</a>. As
    soon as the job is completed by one of the autodeb workers, the logs will
    be available for download.
</p>

<h2>What's next</h2>
<hr>

<p>
    In the future, Autodeb will:

    <ul>
        <li>generate autopkgtests jobs for both the uploaded package</li>
        <li>generate autopkgtests jobs for the package's dependencies</li>
        <li>host the resulting <span class="font-italic">.debs</span></li>
        <li>provide a range of controls for the build environment</li>
        <li>automatically backport and/or update packages from the Debian archive to new upstream versions</li>
    </ul>
</p>
